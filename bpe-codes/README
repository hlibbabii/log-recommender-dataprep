Files:
* <n>_<j>.txt - contains merges for <j>-th <n>-percent chunk of data;
* pearsons_<n>_<m>.scv - contains matrix of pearson coeffitients computed for all combinations of <n>-percent chunks of data, where element [i,j] is a coefficient for chunks i and j; <m> first merges are taken;
* cross_occurences_<n>_<m>.txt - contains a list of pairs (<merge> <occurrences>) which shows that merge <merge> is present in <occurences> <n>-percent chunks; only first <m> merges are taken;
* cross_occurences_summary_<n>_<m>.txt contains a list of pairs (<occurences> <merge_percent>) which show that on average between all the <n>-percent chunks, <merge_percent> percent of merges occur in <occurences> lists; only first <m> merges are taken;
* cooccurence_matrix_<n>_<m>.csv - contains a matrix[i, j] where element [i,j] is the percent of merges that is found both in i-th and j-th <n>-percent chunks ; only first <m> merges are taken;
* cooccurence_matrix_<n>_<m1>_<m2>.csv - contains a matrix[i, j] where element [i,j] is the percent of merges that is found both in <m1> first merges of i-th and <m2> first merges of j-th <n>-percent chunks.
